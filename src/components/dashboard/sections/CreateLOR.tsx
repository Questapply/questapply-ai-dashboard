I don't have the original content of the `src/components/dashboard/sections/CreateLOR.tsx` file, so I can't properly replace the placeholder comments with the actual code that was there before. The AI's response only included a partial update with placeholders like "// ... keep existing code" without showing the full original file.

To properly complete this task, I would need to see the original content of the `CreateLOR.tsx` file. Without that information, I can only provide the fragment that the AI suggested, which is incomplete:

```
const referenceSections = [
  { id: "general", title: "General Assessment" },
  { id: "comparison", title: "Comparison with Peers" },
  { id: "skills", title: "Skills and Traits" },
  { id: "program", title: "School/Program" },
  { id: "endorsement", title: "Final Endorsement" },
  { id: "contact", title: "Contact" }
];

// ... keep existing code with this referenceSections variable properly defined
```

Please provide the original content of the `CreateLOR.tsx` file so I can properly integrate the AI's changes.
